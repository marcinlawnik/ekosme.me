## History

This project started out as a quick mvp back in October 2010.
The first idea was to share funny images/memes with my schoolmates,
because the school jokes ("Tekstasy") gathered in the school newspaper
("Ekosik") became increasingly unfunny. It was to have snapchat-like
functionality, so that the image would disappear after 30sec.
But then people were taking screenshots anyway, so I decided
to just keep on doing what it did best - sharing images by mail
to a closed group of subscribers.

## Various knowledge bits to clean up

####Fixing permissions for /storage

    http://stackoverflow.com/a/22192814

I think chmod -777 is a bad practice.

To solve permissions issue on Laravel, I've done this (with root user):

    cd app/
    chown -R www-data:www-data storage
    cd storage/
    find . -type d -exec chmod 775 {} \; && find . -type f -exec chmod 664 {} \;
    And always in app/storage directory :
    chown your_user:user_group .gitignore cache/.gitignore logs/.gitignore meta/.gitignore sessions/.gitignore views/.gitignore

Now, exit the root user, and it's ok.
EDIT : this was for Laravel4. This doesn't works for Laravel5 because of a different structure.

####Finding what apache is running as

####Xdebug tracing
